# Market_Mix_Modelling
Imagine that you are a part of the marketing team working on budget optimisation. You need to develop a market mix model to observe the actual impact of different marketing variables over the last year. Using your understanding of the model, you have to recommend the optimal budget allocation for different marketing levers for the next year.
